This is my first task with Technigo Bootcamp. The task was to create a classic magazine with main focus on boxmodel, flexbox, responsive design and grid. 

## The problem
The first thing I did when I got the task was to look through different images/websites to find some inspiration for my project. After deciding that the subject should be about beauty, I started to download the images I wanted to use from unsplash.com, fonts from google and got inspiration for color from coolors.co. 

I didn’t have any problem at first. However, when I was going to do some final touches on the code so the website would look like the sketch we got I had some problems with the responsive design for the navbar. 

I was supposed to do navbar with a “hamburger” icon and a logo to the left side on the mobile screen and then change the logo to the center of the links in the tablet screen. Last part was to change the logo back to the left and the links to the right side on the desktop screen. I managed to solve my problem by asking the question in StackOverflow. I got a really good answer and changed the structure in my html file which solved my problem. 

If I had more time I would add more sections to my webpage, for instance a part that looks like instagram feed, which is very common to have on websites.  

For my next project I will use Figma and design a prototype for my website before I start to code.
